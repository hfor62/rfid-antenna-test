# 🐾 Smart RFID Cat Door – Open Source Project

Welcome to the **RFID Cat Door Project**, an open-source initiative to build a smart, pet-safe, and customizable cat entrance using:

- 📡 RFID tag detection (FDX-B animal chips)
- 🤖 ESP32 microcontroller
- 🔐 Servo-controlled lock
- ☁️ Cloud integration via Firebase
- 🧩 Fully 3D-printed, modular design

This project is built for **DIY enthusiasts** who want to give their cat (or dog!) controlled freedom, with powerful data logging and customization options.

## 📚 Start Here – Project Modules

### 1. 🧪 [RFID Reader Test](./README.md)
Get your RFID reader working with your ESP32 or Arduino board.
> Basic hex-dump and validation of raw RFID data – minimal code, maximal compatibility.

### 2. 🌀 [Print and Wind the Coil Antenna](./ANTENNA.md)
Learn how to use the **included flat antenna** or build your **own 3D-printed coil**.
> Use 35 windings, and your cat will never go undetected.

### 3. ☁️ Cloud Connection (coming soon)
Setup your RFID cat door to connect to our **Firebase-based cloud platform**, with:
- Live logging
- Cat entry tracking
- Web dashboard & mobile notifications *(planned)*
